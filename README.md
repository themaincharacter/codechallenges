==============
1)numbers game
==============
code written for devdraft code chellenge, my first entered. Goal of the game was to predict whether to go first or second given an input of x pairs of 3 numbers and versing an assumed intelegent A.I. I think I gave a good explanation of my code in the comments of the code itself so for my implementation see that. 

==================
2)Lowest cost path
==================
for devdraft challenge, need to find the path of lowest cost between train paths where switching between trains was allowed when at the same path. I basically went the route of storing all possible outcomes and then finding the minimum cost path out of all the sums possible.

====================
3)Online matchmaking
====================
last one for dedraft challenge, this was a fun one that hit at home. basically as the name applies. Given player ids, elos(ranking), and status (offline or online). This was a pretty straight forward problem.
